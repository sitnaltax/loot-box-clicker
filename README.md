# Loot Box Clicker

An idle game designed to let you get the thrill of opening ever-better treasure boxes without any pressure to pay for them. (Or any pesky game in the way, for that matter.)

## Gameplay

Press Adventure to go on an adventure and collect treasure. The more power you have, the more treasure you collect. As your power increases you'll eventually be able to collect better types of currency, which can be used to purchase better chests with better loot.

You automatically adventure once a second, whether or not you are clicking.

## Loot Boxes and Equipment

Every loot box has one piece of equipment. Basic chests can hold equipment from any of the first five slots; every subsequent loot box makes one more slot available until they're all available. Your power is the product of the power of each equipment piece. (The best three loot boxes all get bonus rolls to have better equipment, with cosmic chests having many chances.)

Higher level loot boxes not only hold equipment in more slots; the equipment is more powerful baseline and has a chance to have one or more enchantments. The higher level the loot box, the more enchantments the item can possibly have.

Fancier equipment comes with a color, roughly corresponding to the familiar green/blue/purple/orange rarity scheme. Color roughly indicates how rare the item is for the box it appears in, so a blue item might be weaker than a green item from a chest the next level up.

You can donate unwanted equipment for Fame, which you can use at the Trainer for passive bonuses.

When you buy chests, they open in a last-in-first-out order. So if you buy 5 of an expensive chest, wait for them to open before you buy 300 of the cheap chest. Likewise, if you're currently cracking 300 cheap chests and can afford 1 of an expensive one, just buy it and you'll open it next.

Some loot boxes (1 in 8) also contain an art object or trinket which cannot be equipped, but can be donated for additional Fame.

## Trainer

At the trainer, you can spend Fame to increase your passive abilities. The cost of each increases exponentially by rank.

### Critical Chance

Increases the chance per adventure that you have a "critical success", which greatly increases the amount of treasure you get (and is a good way to get the next currency up). This chance starts out at 4% and increases by 1% per 15 ranks. This chance also "explodes" which means if you get a critical success, you have the chance to try again and further multiply the rewards of the adventure.

### Critical Power

Increases the degree to which a critical success grants additional treasure. It starts out as a 5x multiplier and increases an additional 1x per 15 ranks.

### Auto-Donate

Whenever you open an item in a chest that isn't an upgrade for you, you have a 1/4 chance per rank of Auto-Donate for it to be automatically donated rather than going into your inventory.

### Multi-Buy

Whenever you click to buy a chest, you'll buy 5 times more for every rank of this skill (so 5, 25, 125, etc.), limited by how much of the currency you have.

### Advanced Avarice

Whenever you open a chest, you have a 7% chance per rank of this skill to open another one immediately. This can repeat as long as you have chests and luck, so with enough ranks and luck you can open 3, 4, or more at a time.
